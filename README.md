# Testify Mocking: A Refactoring Guide for Golang
This repository contains the refactored code demonstrating how to replace custom, hand-coded Test Doubles with the dedicated mocking utilities provided by the popular Testify toolkit in Golang.

This video shows how to integrate the mocking features of Testify to write clean, concise, and highly expressive unit tests, making your TDD workflow more efficient.

## üí° What This Code Demonstrates
  - Testify Mocking: Learn how to install and integrate Testify's mocking package into your Go project.
  - Concise Tests: See how framework-based mocks reduce boilerplate and make test assertions more readable.
  - Refactoring for Efficiency: Compare the complexity of hand-coded mocks (from episodes 027‚Äì030) with the clean implementation provided by the Testify framework.

## üöÄ Getting Started with the Code

```shell
git clone https://github.com/the-engineering-coach/032-testify-test-doubles
cd 032-testify-test-doubles
```

Run the entire test suite:

```shell
go test ./...
```
